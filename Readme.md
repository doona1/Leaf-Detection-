# Leaf Disease Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on the detection of plant leaf diseases using a machine learning model. The system utilizes pre-trained models such as Inception V3 and VGG16 on the Plant Village dataset. Transfer learning was applied, and the model weights were fine-tuned, resulting in high accuracies of 97% and 98%.
